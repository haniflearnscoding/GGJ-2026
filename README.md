## Key Takeaways from Game Design Talk

### Mindset
- **Perfect is the enemy of good** - Focus on finishing, not perfection
- **Execution > Ideas** - A finished simple game beats an unfinished complex one
- Aim for **5-10 minutes of polished content**

### Goals (Pick One)
1. **Learning** - Use the jam to learn a specific tool/asset/feature
2. **Execution** - Make the best game possible within the timeframe

### Schedule (48hr Jam)
| Day | Phase | Milestone |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Day 1 | Theme + Ideation | Prototype |
| Day 2 | Core Dev + Iteration | Alpha → Feature Lock |
| Day 3 | Polish | Content Lock → Submission |

### Scoping Tips
- Scope **way down** - conservative scoping = comfortable jam
- Play to team strengths
- Avoid complex unknowns (unless learning is the goal)
- The **first 2 minutes** are most important for players
- Don't forget: menus, onboarding, audio, settings

### Priorities
1. **Find the fun** on Day 1 with a playable prototype
2. **Feel > Content** early on
3. Add juice and sound early
4. Leave time for actual levels/content (beginning/middle/end)
5. **Playtest throughout**

### Polish Phase
- Plan more polish time than needed
- Don't let polish be a luxury
- Add juice to interactions
- Implement user feedback
- Look for quick wins
